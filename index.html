                About the Legend
            </h1>
            <p>
                ðŸ‘‰ A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, in full
                Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam,
                was born on october 15, 1931, in
                Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, India. <br><br>
                ðŸ‘‰ He Served as the 11th President of
                India from 2002 to 2007. <br><br>
                ðŸ‘‰ Kalam earned a degree in aeronautical
                engineering from the Madras Institute of
                Technology and in 1958 joined the Defence
                Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). <br><br>
                ðŸ‘‰ In 1969, he moved to the Indian Space Research
                Organisation, where he was project director of the
                SLV- III, the first satellite launch vehicle that was both designed and produced
                in India.
                <br><br>
                ðŸ‘‰ Rejoining DRDO in 1982, Kalam planned the program
                that produced a number of successful missiles, which
                helped earn him the nickname <strong>"Missile Man."</strong>
                <br><br>
                ðŸ‘‰ He also played a pivotal organisational, technical,
                and political role in India's Pokhran - II nuclear tests
                in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.
                <br><br>
                ðŸ‘‰ From 1992 to 1997 Kalam was scientific adviser to the Defence
                minister, and he latter served as principal scientific adviser (1999-2001)
                to the government with the rank of cabinet minister. <br><br>
                ðŸ‘‰ His prominent role in the country's 1998 nuclear weapons tests
                solidified India as a nuclear power and established Kalam as a
                national hero, although the tests caused great concern
                in the international community.<br><br>
